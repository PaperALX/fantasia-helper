The tree started to show signs of life while being fueled by the passion-filled energy of the residents of the lava region. The lava region has been known to have survived by only the passions of its residents in the midst of all the darkness, burning flames and heat surrounding the region. Apparently the dark and shady emotions of the humans living in the area have somehow been absorbed by Zakum over time. Zakum used to be a small, neglected tree, but has now grown powerful thanks to the energy of the human residents of the lava region, who have harbored a great force that even exceeds that of humans...",

    "episode": "Form : Reptile\n\nThe first dragon that's ever stood up against the dragon chief, Nine Spirit, who was the former ruler over Minar Forest. Horntail assembled an army of evil dragons to create an evil force that instigated the historically-known Dragon War. Horntail seemed to be the more powerful one at the beginning, but Nine Spirit's longstanding experience and wisdom as a leader seemed to overpower Horntail's inexperience. In the end, Horntail broke the Pact between the dragons and Halflings and attacked the Halflings' village, stealing the egg of Nine Spirit which they were protecting. This was a crime that no dragon known as the guardian of order should have committed. Ultimately, Horntail overthrew the reign of Nine Spirit, and the forest was conquered by the demonic servants of Horntail. Since then, no traces of true, honorable dragons could be found in the forest. Horntail, who has three heads and, subsequently, three different minds, is currently hiding in a cave to heal his wounds, and plotting to rule the regions even past Leafre using the egg of Nine Spirit.",
